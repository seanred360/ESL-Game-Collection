If you extract the DoxyGenDocsForOSG.zip file it will generate a folder
(zip file name), which contains a folder labelled "html". Inside of "html"
there is a file named index.html...  If you launch this file with firefox,
chrome, or whatever you use as your default broswer, it will open the Doxygen
Docs for the Object Slicing Game.  I find making a shortcut to the index.html
and placing it up one directory , or somewhere convient to be the best approach.
Anyway... this will open the "off-line" docs page..

There you can see the Classes, other Members, and the /// comments
for the .cs files, etc...

This can be useful.  There are also copies of the source files there, if you go to
a specific file, and then click the link "Go to the source code of this file"
and that will take you to a copy of the actual script, which will also contain 
all of the // comments as well.  This is just a searchable form of the code for OSG... 
which you can view without entering the IDE, if that is more convienent.  They
are something I use in other projects were comments/instruction is key, and I 
have just started including them in these examples as well.
