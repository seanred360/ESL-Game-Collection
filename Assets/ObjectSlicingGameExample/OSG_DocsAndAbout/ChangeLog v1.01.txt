ChangeLog for Version 1.01 of SwingShip Example Game.

1.) I created an Additional Scene that is not in the build settings / scene flow.  It shows the usage
	of sprites, instead of meshes.  This has been asked about by several individuals.  This is the sort
	of thing that I forget... To me everything is a GameObject (when referring to objects in lots of ways),
	and I think Mesh vs SpriteRenderer.. whats the difference?... and so I forgot to be Specific, and show
	how it can be done.  My apologies.  So... I set up a scene.  Duplicated the defaul "CutAnimations"(and
	renamed them for sprite usage), since with a mesh we can rotate on any axis, but with a sprite rotating on
	the y axis would result in showing that the sprite is "flat".  So the modified animations for sprites will
	on turn on a camera/sprite friendly axis.  This means we have to be a little better about our art(making it
	more isometric looking (like it has some depth.), and making sure sprites have the right draw order.)  If you
	are trying to use sprites then this scene, and some extra documentation I am providing should help quite a bit.

2.) Fixed an issue where RARELY if a player tries to exit/hit home button (when about to lose in Classic Mode), that an
	array index out of range exception can occur.  This happens when resources are being destroyed and new loaded (behind fader)
	and there is a final reference to something that doesn't exist.  I can only make this happen in 1 of 4 times, BUT
	it still needed to be dealt with.  See the #region'd long exception explanation in DojoBoundaryController.cs for
	more details.
	
That is the only changes to the base kit at this time...
